# Playing Flappy bird with Reinforcement Learning

>
+ FlappyBird module: The simulator of Flappy bird in python and pygame.  
*The pics are copied from [FlappyBirdRL](https://github.com/SarvagyaVaish/FlappyBirdRL) which is a javascript simulator.*   
  
+ Algorithm module: QLearning, DQN, PolicyGradient, Actor-critic.
*The neural networks are pre-trained. However, the performance of PG and AC is not pretty well.*
